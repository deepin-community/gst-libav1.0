	* ext/libav/gstavdemux.c:
	  gst-libav: Fix synchronization issues and errors created by the forwarding of segment events by demuxer.
	  In order to play nicely with `ffmpeg`, demuxers in `gst-libav` have to make
	  buffers available to `ffmpeg` while taking the blocking I/O model in `ffmpeg`
	  into account, which results in buffers not being sent downstream until `ffmpeg`
	  has processed them in its separate thread.
	  In constrast, many `gstreamer` events are simply forwarded downstream.
	  Currently `GST_EVENT_SEGMENT` events are forwarded downstream without any
	  processing, which can potentially result in:
	  * `GST_EVENT_SEGMENT` events being out of sync with buffers
	  * `GST_EVENT_SEGMENT` events going out that are incorrect because they apply
	  to data seen by the demuxer, but not necessarily seen by downstream elements
	  I came across this bug when I was attempting to enable G723.1 demuxing/decoding
	  using the G723.1 demuxer and decoder provided by `ffmpeg`.  I wrote tests to
	  verify support for the functionality, and found that, in push mode,
	  `GST_EVENT_SEGMENT` events pushed to the demuxer by the upstream `filesrc`
	  element would be forwarded to the decoder without modification, resulting in
	  an internal data streaming error.  With this patch, tests work in both push and
	  pull mode.
	  This patch solves the problem by disabling the forwarding of
	  `GST_EVENT_SEGMENT` events downstream (an initial `GST_EVENT_SEGMENT` event is
	  still pushed downstream by the demuxer).  It's possible there's a better way to
	  do this, but, having looked at how a few different `gstreamer` demuxers deal
	  with `GST_EVENT_SEGMENT` events, it seems like the processing is somewhat
	  specific to the demuxer implementation, whereas `gst-libav` has one general way
	  of handling the situation for any `ffmpeg` demuxer.  Perhaps there's a better
	  way to solve this using the `ffmpeg` API to take advantage of specific demuxer
	  details.  IDK.

	* meson.build:
	  meson: Use implicit builtin dirs in pkgconfig generation
	  Starting with Meson 0.62, meson automatically populates the variables
	  list in the pkgconfig file if you reference builtin directories in the
	  pkgconfig file (whether via a custom pkgconfig variable or elsewhere).
	  We need this, because ${prefix}/libexec is a hard-coded value which is
	  incorrect on, for example, Debian.
	  Bump requirement to 0.62, and remove version compares that retained
	  support for older Meson versions.

	* docs/gst_plugins_cache.json:
	  Build documentation for rust plugins
	  - Update the docker image we use, starting using the standard one adding
	  `gtk4-doc` as required by rust plugins
	  - Update the plugins_doc_caches as required, some more plugins are built
	  with the new image
	  - Install ninja from pip as the version from F31 is too old
	  - Avoid buildings all GSreamer plugins when building the doc as it takes
	  time and resources for no good reason
	  - Stop linking to `GInstanceInitFunc` as it is not present in latest GLib
	  documentation, leading to warnings in hotdoc.

	  meson: Build with -Wl,-z,nodelete to prevent unloading of dynamic libraries and plugins
	  GLib made the unfortunate decision to prevent libgobject from ever being

	  can't ever be unloaded either (and any library that depends on those,
	  ad nauseam).

	  avviddec, video.c, h265parse: Workaround for broken field-based interlaced encoders
	  Some encoders (e.g. Makito) have H265 field-based interlacing, but then
	  also specify an 1:2 pixel aspect ratio. That makes it kind-of work with
	  decoders that don't properly support field-based decoding, but makes us
	  end up with the wrong aspect ratio if we implement everything properly.
	  As a workaround, detect 1:2 pixel aspect ratio for field-based
	  interlacing, and check if making that 1:1 would make the new display
	  aspect ratio common. In that case, we override it with 1:1.
